This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for time series analysis and forecasting of an exchange rate dataset. The project includes:
Data Exploration: Visualizing the exchange rate over time to identify trends and anomalies.
Model Fitting: Using ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing models to capture the data's patterns.
Model Comparison: Evaluating models based on AIC, MAE, and RMSE to determine the best fit.
Forecasting: Generating and visualizing out-of-sample forecasts for future exchange rates.
